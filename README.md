## Features

**Programming Assistance**  
Get help with coding problems, syntax errors, and best practices.

**Interactive Chat**  
Communicate with Vibe Coding in real-time. Ask questions and receive instant responses.

**Select Code to AI**  
Easily select code snippets and ask Vibe Coding for explanations, debugging help, or improvements directly.

**Continue the Code Based on the Provided Comment with Shift+Enter Key**  
Effortlessly extend your code by leveraging the AI's understanding of your comments to generate relevant and context-aware code snippets that follow your intended logic and requirements.  
ðŸ‘‰ Press `Shift+Enter` after a comment in your code.

**Code Suggestions / Code Completions**  
Context-aware code snippets that follow your intended logic and requirements.  
ðŸ‘‰ Press `Shift+Enter+.` after your code.

**Generate Full CRUD Pages from Model Schema**  
Automatically generate complete frontend components (Form, List, Detail, Schema, Action) from a simple model description.  
- Just ask: *"Generate model Goat with field: id, name, age, breed"*
- Vibe Coding will guide you to complete the schema.
- Once complete, it generates ready-to-use TypeScript and React files.
- Files are saved directly into your project under `src/models/<model-name>/`.

**Teach AI Current Code ðŸ”„**  
This feature allows you to train the AI with a sampled subset of the code in your workspace. By doing so, the AI gains a better understanding of the context, structure, and logic of your code. This helps the AI provide more accurate and relevant suggestions, explanations, and completions tailored to your specific project.
Note: Only a sampled subset of files is used, not the full project.

> âœ… Files generated:
> - `model.schema.ts` (Zod validation)
> - `ModelForm.tsx` (React form)
> - `ModelList.tsx` (Table/list view)
> - `ModelDetailView.tsx` (Detail page)
> - `model.action.ts` (API calls)
