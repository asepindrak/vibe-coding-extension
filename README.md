# 🚀 What's New in v2 (Major Update)

## 🤖 Agent Mode --- Autonomous Task Execution

Turn Vibe Coding into a real AI coding agent.

Agent Mode can:

- Plan tasks automatically\
- Think step-by-step before execution\
- Execute actions directly in your workspace

### The agent can:

- 📄 Read files and analyze code
- ✏️ Modify files using diff-based updates
- 🆕 Create new files
- 🖥 Execute terminal commands
- 🧠 Reason per step before making changes

### Example use cases:

- Refactor entire modules
- Implement features across multiple files
- Fix complex bugs with multi-step reasoning
- Run migrations or build commands

Just describe the task.\
VICO handles the plan → reasoning → execution cycle automatically.
